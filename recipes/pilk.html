    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pilk can come in many varieties. The type that I will be covering is the 
        pickle version. Pilk (pickles and milk)<br> consists of simple, honest ingredients.
        There are slight differences in how it can be prepared. Some people <br>prefer to 
        eat chunks of pickle in a bowl as if it were cereal. Other people (such as myself)
        drink milk mixed <br> with pickle juice.

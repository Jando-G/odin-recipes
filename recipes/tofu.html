    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tofu is a strange food that is made of soybeans. I have never actually seen
        soybeans before. My brother is vegan so I've seen soy plenty of times and
        let me tell ya, those bags of soy from costco <br>do not look like they contain
        anything resembling beans. Tofu can be prepared in many
        different ways which can alter the flavor and texture. The variety of tofu
        recipes out there make this one <br>of the most versatile foods you can prepare.
